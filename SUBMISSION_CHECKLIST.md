- Keywords: 6 terms optimized for QML special session
- Content: Comprehensive scientific details throughout
- Figures: 2 high-quality figures embedded
- References: 12 peer-reviewed citations
- Code availability: GitHub repository public

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- **LaTeX template:** Need to obtain IEEEtran.cls file
- **Author info:** Must be updated with real affiliations (then anonymized for submission)
- **Advisor citations:** Add 1-2 citations to your advisor's relevant work
- **Page count:** Must compile and verify ≤6 pages

## Paper Statistics

**Current Word Count:** ~4,500 words (estimated)
**Sections:** 7 main sections + subsections
**Equations:** 12 mathematical formulations
**Tables:** 2 performance tables
**Figures:** 2 (with options for 2 more)
**References:** 12 citations

## Key Strengths for QML Special Session

1. **NISQ-era focus:** 4-qubit VQC designed for near-term hardware
2. **Real medical dataset:** 18,365 clinical images (not toy data)
3. **Comprehensive benchmarking:** 4 dataset scales, 4 methods compared
4. **Practical metrics:** Training time, inference latency, energy efficiency
5. **Hardware deployment:** Discussion of neuromorphic and quantum hardware
6. **Future directions:** Federated QML, hybrid architectures, transfer learning

## Special Session Alignment

Your paper directly addresses these WCCI QML topics:
- ✅ Variational Quantum Circuits (primary focus)
- ✅ Quantum machine learning for scientific discovery (medical diagnostics)
- ✅ Quantum machine learning systems and benchmarks
- ✅ Hybrid quantum-classical models (mentioned in discussion)
- ✅ NISQ-era applications
